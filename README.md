# CSS Animated Sprites
Animating sprite sheets using CSS keyframe animations. It's kinda dumb.

### Why did I do this?
I was on Reddit in bed at about 1:30am. I saw this [http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jns94/spinjs_a_pure_js_spinner/c2dojw9](comment), thought, "I think I could do that with CSS".
Hopped out of bed, found this [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4503195/css3-sprite-animation-without-tweening](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4503195/css3-sprite-animation-without-tweening).
Then worked till 4:30am making this goofy, goofy thing just for fun. 

### Is it practical?
No

### Could this be used in a more practical way?
I think so, I haven't thought of anything yet, but I really think so.

### Can you do some crazy effects with animating background images with CSS?
Yes, you should give it a try.
